Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted Renee at the beginning of this assignment and we brainstormed the outline for our code and began to write some pseudocode. Throughout the rest of the assignment, I consulted with Sydney and we discussed and worked out some specific bugs we were having.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended TA hours from 1-2 on Sunday. During this time, I fixed a problem I was having with my transcript. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
So far, I like it better than python. I like the organization that {} and ; provide. It seems less messy than python and the format of for loops makes much more sense to me. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
It seems that debugging is easier in a compiled language like java. Working with both of these languages has proved to me that there are always multiple approaches you can take in order to solve the same problem. Although they may seem very different in regards to syntax, a number of different languages could potentially do the same or at least very similar things. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The s4 approach worked really well for me. Writing pseudocode was also critical to my success in this project. It really helped me map out and brainstorm the approach I wanted to take. On the other hand, many times I felt reluctant to ask for help, which led to me having numerous bugs that were easily fixable once I asked for classmates' input. I would advise others taking this course to start with the easy stuff and work their way up to the difficult things, and to always ask for help. Consulting a classmate or TA is more helpful than you may think.
